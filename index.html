                <h1>Bench Mafia</h1>
                <p>HLGU men's basketball team is known for its talented starting five. The team's star players had led the squad to a winning record, but the head coach knew that to make a deep playoff run, they would need more than just their starters. So, he turned to his bench players, a group of unsung heroes who had been working hard all season, waiting for their chance to shine.</p>
                <p>These bench player, that everyone loves (Colby Wood) and Phillip, had become known as the "Bench Mafia" for their close bond and fierce determination. They were always the first ones off the bench to cheer on their teammates, and when they got their chance to play, they played with a level of intensity that caught the other team off guard.</p>
